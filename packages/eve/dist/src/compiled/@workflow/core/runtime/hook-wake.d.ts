 * already exiting and lose the wakeup, while a republish costs the victim one
 * more delivery, which exits without a replay when its log holds nothing new.
 * On an older victim every delivery is a full replay, so the key is the
 * claimer's hook id and the republishes collapse into one wake.
 *
 * Skipped when the victim is the claimer itself (a run taking over its own
 * earlier hook is already running) and when the World recorded no
 * `workflowName` for the victim (a legacy hook; nothing to address a queue

 * A forced creation is followed by a wake of the run it took the token from.
 * If the invocation died between the two, the creation is in the log and the
 * victim was never told; the row itself is the durable record of that debt,

 * did go out costs the victim one more delivery, which exits without a replay
 * when its log holds nothing new.
 *
 * The rule reads nothing written after the creation, which is what makes it
 * sound. Any row can land between the creation and the wake: a step, wait,
 * attribute or other hook row the same suspension writes concurrently
 * (neither engine holds those for the wake), a step or wait terminal from
 * another invocation, a delivery's `hook_received`, a sealed-log `noop`, or a
 * later claimer's `hook_disposed{forceClaimedBy}` taking the token from this

 * skew moves the window's edge by at most that much; a creation dated ahead of
 * `nowMs` counts as recent, and one whose time cannot be read is treated as
